#  Harika's Winter Portfolio 

Welcome to my very first portfolio — a cozy, minimalist web space I created in **December 2024**, inspired by winter nights, warm cocoa, and the magical vibes of Christmas. This project marked the beginning of my journey in building personalized digital spaces — and eventually led me to my **Seasonal Portfolio series** .

## What Is This?

A single-page personal portfolio built with **TailwindCSS** and **Vanilla JavaScript**, themed for winter. It includes:

- Animated snowfall effect (custom JS)
- Soft visual aesthetics with snowy color gradients
- Smooth section scroll
- Projects showcase (at the time)
- Live social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email)
- Fully responsive and mobile-ready

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 / CSS3 / TailwindCSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Font Awesome Icons
- Google Fonts (`Poppins`, `Prata`)
- Deployed via GitHub Pages

## Inspiration

I built this in December 2024, during the first days of the semester. Between hot chocolate and snowfall music playlists, I wanted a space that reflected my energy at the time — quiet, inspired, and ready to build something of my own.

This portfolio later inspired me to create my **Seasonal Portfolio** (Spring , Rainy , Autumn ,Summer ), each with its own vibe and theme.
