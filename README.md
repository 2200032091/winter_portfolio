#  Harika's Winter Portfolio 

Welcome to my very first portfolio — a cozy, minimalist web space I created in **December 2024**, inspired by winter nights, warm cocoa, and the magical vibes of Christmas. This project marked the beginning of my journey in building personalized digital spaces — and eventually led me to my **Seasonal Portfolio series** .

## 💡 Inspiration

I built this in December 2024, during the first days of the semester. Between hot chocolate and snowfall music playlists, I wanted a space that reflected my energy at the time — quiet, inspired, and ready to build something of my own.

This portfolio later inspired me to create my **Seasonal Portfolio** (Spring , Rainy , Autumn ,Summer ), each with its own vibe and theme.
